# Welcome to TaranisProject
Taranis Project is a **quasi real-time port noise mapping web application based on open data**

## About the platform
The front-end is a web application that shows the resultant noise map computed by the noise propagation algorithm in the back-end. The back-end is developed mainly in Python, and uses only public data available in the web to calculate the port noise maps.

## Initial Developers 
- (PhD) Guillermo Quintero Perez
- (BSc Eng) Misael Moreno Del Valle
